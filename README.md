- 👋 Hi, I’m @CantFixxSick
- 👀 I’m interested in ...Ethical Hacking and Application Development as well as Website Creation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Everything, I have just begun to stumble upon a seemingly infinite things that code can do . It's only due to my experience with breaking computers and breaking the law that I ever learned to rebuild them and now, 
I want to become as proficient with software as I am with hardware. Furthermore, I have Ideas and I would like to see them come to Fruition.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...Looking for more or a Highly Tolerant Individual who is OK with working with a Ex Criminal who doesn't know S#!t. 
Someone who is willing to answer my Stupid Question even when it Ventures into things that may be Unethical so that I may apply this New Skill Set to more Non Criminal Activities.  -
